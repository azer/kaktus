## Call For Designers 

Kaktüs needs a lot of help on design. Here is what's missing;

* **Logo:** Current logo is something I had to pick up from Dribble (with the permission of the designer) and it's temporary.
* **Icons:** Kaktüs needs an icon set to interact with user better/
* **Ideas:** Kaktüs needs your ideas on how to improve tabbing and search.

## Development

#### Building From Source

Install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

And get the build out for your target platform. Available platforms are:

* macOS
* win
* linux

So, I usually run;

```
make osx
```

Command to get my build for macOS.

#### Making Changes
Kaktüs is built with [choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo) and [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron). Here is the commands I run to start the development:

```bash
$ make watch-css
$ make watch-js
$ make start
```

## Logo

I'm temporarily using [a cactus image I found on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/1842263-Cactus) as a logo.
